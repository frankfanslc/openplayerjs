# Contributing guidelines

We appreciate the time you are spending to contribute to this project! ðŸ™Œ

In order to have your pull request merged successfully, keep in mind the following key points:

1. Every change you make, **it has to pass in unit tests**; if it's a new feature, new unit tests need to be added.
2. Once the unit tests are running, we should continue aiming for `70%` and above.
3. There is **NO NEED TO BUILD THE DIST FILES**. Just make sure you modify the `src` folder.
4. Prettier and ESLint were set up to create standardized code, so it is important to follow their guidelines.
5. **No disabling of ESLint rules is allowed**, unless there is a legit reason to do it.

That's it! Thanks again for contributing to this awesome project! Hope to review your work soon ðŸ™‚
